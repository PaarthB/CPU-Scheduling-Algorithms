# CPU-Scheduling-Algorithms
Describes a programmable way to visualise the following major CPU Scheduling Algorithms: 

 - First in First Out (FIFO.py)

 - Round Robin (RoundRobin.py) 

 - Shortest Remaining Time (SRT.py)

This requires a process.txt to be populated in the following format:

         <i>P1 0 5</i>
Here P1 is the process name, 0 is the start time, 5 is the duration of the process.
